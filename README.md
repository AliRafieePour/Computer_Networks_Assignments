# Computer_Networks_Assignments

These are my assignments for the Computer Netwroks course.I have used several network libraries including tornado to program these assignments. In the first assignment I have used simple communication between client and server and therefore there are two files for this porpuse. In the second assignment I used torando library in order to make a ticketing system with token based login system for reporting issues to the admins, admins can review tickets, asnwer them or close them. In the packet sniffer section, I sniff all the data on the network of the machine and parse the results.
